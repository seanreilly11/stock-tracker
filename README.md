# Stock Tracker

This is a Next.js project using Firebase and OpenAI.

It is for tracking stocks that you like and either already own or intend to buy where you can keep track of the price you want to buy or sell at alongside the current price of the stock. You can also write your own notes about the stock or get AI suggestions for notes regarding reasons the stock could go up or down.
